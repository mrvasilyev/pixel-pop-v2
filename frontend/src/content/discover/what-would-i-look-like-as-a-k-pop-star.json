    "prompt": "Using the provided image of the subject as reference, transform them into a K-pop idol\u2013style version of themselves, fully preserving their natural facial features, skin tone, ethnicity, and identity. Style the subject with a polished, high-fashion idol aesthetic inspired by contemporary K-pop concept photoshoots, featuring editorial studio lighting with soft glow and clean highlights, a flawless but natural dewy skin finish, and subtle enhancement of the eyes, lips, and hair for a camera-ready look. The subject poses confidently with expressive yet controlled body language, styled in fashion-forward outfits influenced by modern K-pop trends such as elevated streetwear, Y2K accents, chic tailoring, glam punk, or soft ethereal looks, adapted to complement their original clothing style. The atmosphere resembles a professional idol photoshoot, using bold colored backdrops or moody dramatic environments, studio or concert-style lighting, cinematic shadows, and refined color grading, with optional tasteful details like layered jewelry, belts, or statement accessories kept cohesive and restrained. The final image should feel like an authentic K-pop concept photo\u2014crisp, stylish, and aspirational\u2014projecting polished charisma and star presence while clearly remaining the same person.",
