Restyle them in soft holiday lighting with gentle golden highlights. Surround them with festive elements like evergreen branches, warm twinkle lights, and a subtle bokeh glow. Add rich reds, forest greens, and cozy textures reminiscent of classic holiday cards. The final image should feel elegant, warm, and timeless — not cartoonish.",
