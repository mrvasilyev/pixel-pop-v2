If people are present, preserve their identity while using gentle natural light, muted colors, and a relaxed, natural pose and place them in a simple, everyday setting such as a studio or quiet street. Otherwise, treat the scene or object as the subject or subjects, using gentle light, muted colors, and candid framing. The mood should feel personal, fresh, and casually artistic rather than polished or glamorous.",
