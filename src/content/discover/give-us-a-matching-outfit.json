  "prompt": "Transform people into the image as friends standing close together in a softly coordinated, candid moment. They are posed side by side with relaxed, natural expressions, preserving their original facial features and hairstyles. Dress them in subtly matching casual outfits — similar colors, silhouettes, or textures rather than exact duplicates — such as neutral tops and light outerwear. If a pet or animal is included, dress the animal in a coordinated version of the same outfit style so it visually matches the group without overpowering the scene. Set the scene outdoors in gentle, diffused daylight with a calm, everyday atmosphere. Add a soft film look inspired by instant photography, with light grain, muted colors, and a faintly faded finish.",
