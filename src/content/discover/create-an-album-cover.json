On the cover, show the subject with their face and hair full covered in shimmering gold glitter, glowing with a metallic sparkle effect. According to what you know about the user, add a single word as a title written in red handwritten lettering across the cover. The vinyl record is partially pulled out from one side, featuring a smooth multicolor gradient across the disc. Everything rests on a marble green table, visible only slightly at the bottom of the frame. The style should be bold, clean, and photorealistic.",
