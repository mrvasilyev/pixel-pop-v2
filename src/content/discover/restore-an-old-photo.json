Enhance colors to look natural and vibrant (not oversaturated), correct white balance, and gently increase contrast and dynamic range. Reduce noise, fix blur or softness, and refine edges for a crisp, realistic look. Preserve authentic skin tones and textures, avoiding any artificial smoothing or stylization. The final image should feel clean, high-resolution, and true to the original scene, just clearer and more lifelike.",
