Render the subjects in a simplified, friendly illustration style with clean, bold outlines, minimal detail, and no shading or gray tones. Add light holiday elements such as wrapped presents, ornaments, or a decorated tree in the background, keeping the scene uncluttered. Use consistent line weight, smooth contours, large open shapes, and a clear border so the page is easy and relaxing to color.",
