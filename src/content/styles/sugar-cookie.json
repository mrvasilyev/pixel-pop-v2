  "prompt": "Using the provided image as reference, create a tasty, perfectly formed sugar cookie decorated with smooth royal icing based on the subject or image. If the image contains a person, render a simplified icing likeness of their face that clearly resembles them while remaining non-photorealistic; if the image contains an object, animal, or scene, translate its most recognizable features into a friendly royal-icing design using the same logic. The cookie should be stamped in a simple, easy-to-cut silhouette, with the design piped entirely in feasible royal-icing shapes—chunky, smooth lines rather than fine illustration detail, minimal shading, and clean, confident outlines like those used by a skilled cookie artist. Colors should be vibrant, playful, and holiday-friendly without needing to follow real-world color accuracy. Add small, simplified seasonal accents such as holly, snowflakes, sparkles, a scarf, or a beanie rendered as basic piped shapes, avoiding anything overtly religious or denominational. The final result should feel cute, approachable, and clearly edible, emphasizing handcrafted charm, clarity, and a strong resemblance achieved through simplified, piped decoration rather than realism.",
