  "prompt": "Transform the subject into a classic baseball bobblehead figurine that clearly reads as a manufactured collectible rather than a person. Dramatically oversize the head so it feels top heavy and playful, connected to the body by a short, stiff neck that suggests a spring instead of anatomy. Preserve the subject's facial identity, but simplify the features and render the face as smooth matte painted vinyl skin with no pores or lifelike texture. Facial planes should feel simplified and graphic, with minimal surface detail. Hair and beard should appear fully sculpted, formed with carved grooves and solid shapes rather than individual strands. Dress the figure in a baseball uniform inspired by the colors of the subject's original clothing or local geography, translated into a cohesive jersey, cap, and accessories. The body should be small, rigid, and toy like. Place the figurine in front of a printed or softly illustrated baseball stadium backdrop so the scene reads as a collectible display, nostalgic and unmistakably a bobblehead. Do not include a name on the figurine.",
